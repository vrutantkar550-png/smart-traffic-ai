# 🚦 Smart Traffic Signal Control using AI (YOLOv5)

## 📌 Project Overview

Traffic congestion is a major issue in modern cities, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. Traditional traffic signal systems operate on fixed timers, which are inefficient under dynamic traffic conditions.

This project presents a **Smart Traffic Signal Control System using Artificial Intelligence**, where signal timings are dynamically adjusted based on real-time traffic density using **YOLOv5 object detection**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* 🚗 Detect and count vehicles in real-time
* ⏱ Dynamically adjust traffic signal timing
* 🌱 Reduce fuel consumption and pollution
* 🚑 Improve response for emergency vehicles (future scope)
* 🏙 Contribute to smart city development

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* ✔ Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv5
* ✔ Dynamic traffic signal timing
* ✔ Works with video input (CCTV / recorded footage)
* ✔ Displays bounding boxes and vehicle count
* ✔ Modular and scalable architecture
